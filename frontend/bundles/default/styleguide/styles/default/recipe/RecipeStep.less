/**
    Given the focus of the training isn't so much about styling, you can copy and paste this file 
    into your project.

    KEY CONCEPT HERE: 
    The key concept represented here is we aim to be consistent in how we name .hbs templates, .less 
    stylesheets as well as the css class names that represent them. For example here RecipeStep is the
    name of our .hbs component, and thus we use that for its css ClassName and therefore less as well. 

    Also you can see a correction in RecipeStep.hbs which changes RecipeStep-title, to RecipeStep-heading.
    This is to highlight our typical naming convention for markup related to fields of the component. Exceptions
    to this convention of course are the case where you are reusing another component as an .hbs include for example.
